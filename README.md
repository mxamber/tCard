# tCard

Telegram can export its contacts as a JSON file. This tool takes the file as its first and only parameter and produces a folder of vCards out of it. Due to the completely fucked nature of Telegram's export data (including duplicate contacts, stripping the phone numbers from 9/10 accounts, and exporting useless analytics metrics such as chat frequency), the resulting vCards will mostly be useless (only contain the user's name). Nevertheless, do with this what you will.
